# Brane Standard Library
This repository provides a standard collection of packages for a running [Brane](https://github.com/epi-project/brane) instance.


## Repository structure
The individual packages are located under each folder in the repository root under the same name as their Brane identifier. For example, the `cat` package is available in the folder `/cat`. Each folder contains a README.md with more information about that package.

For a brief overview, see the table [below](#overview).

To download a package, you can run the following command on your local machine (we assume that you have the [Brane Command-Line Interface](https://github.com/epi-project/brane/releases/latest) installed):
```bash
brane import epi-project/brane-std ./<package_name>/container.yml
```
where you should replace `<package_name>` with the name of the package you like to install (e.g., `cat`).
